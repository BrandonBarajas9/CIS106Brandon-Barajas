## Assignment 1

I decided to take this class because I am interested in pursuing cybersecurity as a career. Since I currently have no experience or knowledge on this field, I would like to begin learning the basics and also become more familiar with it so it can benefit me in the future. I plan on attending Aurora University for cybersecurity after Harper. I feel that it is important for me to take this class so that I can have some knowledge and also so I can know what to expect when I begin to take my courses there. I would like to put myself in a position to be as successful as possible so that is why I would like to take this class.
